#Logical Sentence Puzzle
The goal of this project was to create working classes that would make code given to us work(the code run in the main method). This includes creating classes for PropositionConstants, different types of LogicalSentences, and creating a TruthAssignment class for storing the value of each PropositionConstant. The overall structure for this assignment has a LogicalSentence superclass which has subclasses below it, things such as the Negation class, Conjunction class, and Disjunction class. There were also two methods in the main class, legal() returns whether or not a give string is a legal logical sentence, and the other method find match returns the matching parenthesis index for the first open parenthesis and -1 if there is no matching parenthesis. Some of the resources I used were Mr. Kuszmaul's teachings in class on how to structure the code and how to write the classes, and one algorithm off stack overflow for how to find the matching parenthesis.
