This cow project is based off of the basic cow code that could be found on paleyontology. What I did in this project was modifiy the code already given
and add on features to the "cow". My fulfills the the specifications as I added on two pairs of legs for the cow and changed the body to a more oval
shape. I also added on an eye to the "cow" to make it even more realistic. As of right now, this project doesn't have any errors. The structure of this
code contains two classes. The first class, CowFrame, is the class which creates the actual window containing the cow and the ovals which make up the 
cow. The second class, Main, is the code which instantiates the CowFrame class and sets it to visible. This is the code which actually create the frame
making it visible to the user.
